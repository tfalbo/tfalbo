# Hello! 

I am a Software Engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I currently work as a Site Reliability Engineer at Quinto Andar. Before that, I have worked at Globo.com, Udacity and RDStation. 

I like getting involved with tech events and communities, especially when they are focused on including women in technology. Currently, I lead the DevOps Girls Brazil chapter.

In addition to programming languages, I've always been interested in natural languages. For that reason, I decided to study Linguistics as a personal interest, in which I will be graduating in 2020.
